JUST AFTER DUSK I STOPPED TO REFUEL THE CAR. AT THAT POINT THE OVERHEAD DOME LIGHT TURNED ON, AND WOULD NOT TURN OFF.  I DROVE TO THE NEXT REST AREA AND STOPPED TO READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL. IT PROVIDED NO USEFUL INFORMATION ON TURNING OFF THE LIGHT. HOWEVER, WHILE I WAS ALONE IN THE REST AREA READING THE MANUAL IN A CAR LIT UP LIKE A SPOTLIGHT(AND I AM FEMALE), A STRANGE MAN APPROACHED MY CAR FROM BEHIND WITH WHAT I ASSUME WERE BAD INTENTIONS. I THEN DROVE ANOTHER 50 MILES TO A TOTAL OF 7 GAS STATIONS BEFORE I FOUND ONE WITH AN ATTENDANT. HE ALSO HAD NO IDEA HOW TO TURN OFF THE DOME LIGHT.  I THEN HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SPENDING THE NIGHT IN A RENTAL CAR IN A PARKING LIGHT NEAR THE INTERSTATE, OR DRIVNG HOME WITH A LIT DOME LIGHT AND CLOSE TO ZERO VISIBILITY.  AS MY LIFE INSURANCE IS PAID UP, I CHOSE OPTION (B.) AND DROVE HOME.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NHTSA SHOULD REQUIRE CAR MANUFACTURERS, AND ESPECIALLY THIS CAR MANUFACTURER, TO SUPPLY ALL INTERIOR LIGHTS WITH A POSITIVE ON-OFF SWITCH.

REPEATED REQUESTS TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAVE NOT LEAD TO ANY ACTION BEING TAKEN.  I BELIEVE THAT MY VEHICLE IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THROUGH ANY AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED WATER.
